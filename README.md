CloudTunes provides a unified interface 
for music stored in the cloud (YouTube, Dropbox, etc.) and integrates with 
[Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/api), Facebook, 
and [Musicbrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/) for metadata, discovery, 
and social experience. It is similar to services like Spotify, 
except instead of local tracks and the fixed Spotify catalog, 
CloudTunes uses your files stored in Dropbox and music videos on YouTube.

## The Story

CloudTunes is a side project of 
[@jakubroztocil](https://twitter.com/jakubroztocil) who is a bit of a 
[music nerd](http://last.fm/user/oswaldcz) and who likes to 
[build stuff](https://github.com/jakubroztocil).  In 2012 he decided 
to create an iTunes-like webapp to **make music stored all over the cloud 
easily discoverable and accessible:** hence *CloudTunes*. 

One of the goals was to experiment with a bunch of new technologies as well.
Later the side-project has been largely abandoned due to other more pressing 
projects. In the autumn of 2014 CloudTunes has been open-sourced *"as is"* 
(i.e. alpha quality, lack of polish, tests and docs).


## Technology

decoupled and communicate via a JSON REST API and a WebSocket connection:


### [`cloudtunes-server`](cloudtunes-server)

Written in **Python,** uses Tornado, Celery, Mongo DB, MongoEngine, Redis.


### [`cloudtunes-webapp`](cloudtunes-webapp) 
**Single-page app.** Written in **CoffeeScript and Sass,** uses Brunch, 
Backbone.js, SocketIO, Handlebars, Compass, SoundManager.
